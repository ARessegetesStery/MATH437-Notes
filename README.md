# MATH437-Notes

Notes in this repository is based on the lecture slides on *Differential Geometry* by [Prof. Horst Hohberger](https://umji.sjtu.edu.cn/~horst/index.html) held in 2022 Summer, at University of Michigan-Shanghai Jiao Tong University Joint Institute (UM-SJTU JI). Unfortunately, such odds came that this course was not offered in 2023 Summer, when I could possibly digest all the materials. This has been a really big pity for me.

Prof. [Horst Hohberger](https://umji.sjtu.edu.cn/~horst/index.html) has also taught many analysis courses, which initiated my exposure to rigorous treatment of mathematics. I would also like to thank him here for unveiling the beauty of mathematics to me.
